Ayushman Bharat Amendment 2023

The Ayushman Bharat scheme was expanded in 2023 to include additional beneficiaries. The health coverage of Rs 5 lakh per family was maintained, but the scope was extended to cover more procedures including advanced cardiac surgeries and cancer treatments.

The PM-JAY scheme under Ayushman Bharat now covers over 55 crore beneficiaries across India. The government allocated Rs 8500 crore for the scheme in 2023 budget.

New Health and Wellness Centers were established in tribal and remote areas to ensure last-mile healthcare delivery.
