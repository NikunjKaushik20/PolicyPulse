Year 2019:
Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) was launched to promote solar energy in agriculture. Three components: solar pumps for farmers, grid-connected solar on barren land, and solarization of existing pumps. Target of 25.75 GW solar capacity addition by 2022. 60% central and state subsidy for solar pumps. Farmers could sell surplus power to DISCOMs.

Year 2020:
0.5 lakh solar pumps installed under Component-A. COVID slowed installation but scheme remained priority. States developed detailed implementation plans. Manufacturing base for solar pumps expanded. Ground-mounted solar projects faced land issues.

Year 2021:
Component-B revised with VGF model for solar projects. 2 lakh solar pumps cumulative installation. Feeder-level solarization piloted for daytime power. EESL and SECI as implementing agencies strengthened. PM-KUSUM linked to PM-KISAN beneficiary priority.

Year 2022:
4 lakh solar pumps achieved. 5000 MW grid-connected solar under Component-B. Solarization of agricultural feeders expanded. Cost of solar pumps reduced 30% due to manufacturing scale. Farmer income from solar sales documented.

Year 2023:
Target revised upward to 30.8 GW capacity. 6 lakh solar pumps cumulative. Rooftop solar for rural households added. Smart solar pump controllers integrated. Agri-voltaic pilots showing dual land use.

Year 2024:
PM Surya Ghar announced complementing PM-KUSUM. 10 lakh solar pump target. Farmer cooperatives for solar projects encouraged. Green hydrogen production from surplus solar explored. Election year saw enhanced subsidy announcements.

Year 2025:
15 lakh cumulative solar pumps. India leads global agricultural solar adoption. Net-zero agriculture pilots using KUSUM infrastructure. AI-based irrigation optimization with solar pumps. Rural energy independence advancing.
