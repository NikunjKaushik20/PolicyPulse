Year 2020:
Cabinet approved the National Education Policy 2020, the first major reform in 34 years promising systemic transformation. The traditional 10+2 structure was replaced with 5+3+3+4 model aligned with cognitive development stages. Emphasis on mother tongue instruction in early years sparked intense debate about language policy. Foundational literacy and numeracy by Grade 3 was set as universal target for 2026. Critics warned regional language emphasis might disadvantage students in national competitive examinations.

Year 2021:
Foundational Literacy and Numeracy Mission was launched to ensure universal basic skills by 2026. Schools began NEP implementation pilots testing new curriculum frameworks and pedagogical approaches. Massive teacher training programs scaled nationwide to prepare educators for fundamental pedagogical shift. Infrastructure and funding gaps in resource-poor states delayed NEP rollout particularly in eastern regions. Early adopter institutions reported positive initial experiences with flexibility and reduced content burden.

Year 2022:
CBSE schools began curriculum revision with textbooks redesigned to reduce load and focus on competencies. Assessment reforms shifted emphasis from rote memorization to application of concepts and critical thinking. However, implementation challenges persisted in states lacking adequate infrastructure and trained teachers. Multidisciplinary approach allowed flexible subject combinations breaking rigid science-commerce-arts divisions. Parents and students remained concerned about practical implications for competitive exam preparation.

Year 2023:
Multidisciplinary undergraduate programs began in higher education with flexible subject combination options. Vocational skill courses were integrated from Grade 6 preparing students for workforce requirements. IIT entrance reforms aligned JEE with NEP philosophy testing conceptual understanding over coaching. The curriculum revision showed early promising results in pilot schools and institutions. However, scaling quality implementation across diverse contexts remained significant challenge.

Year 2024:
Four-year undergraduate degrees with research component became operational in major universities nationwide. Academic Credit Bank enabled students to accumulate and transfer credits across different institutions. Digital classroom infrastructure reached 2 lakh schools enabling personalized and technology-enhanced learning. Teacher capacity building remained critical bottleneck limiting quality implementation pace. Early learning outcome assessments showed improvement in foundational literacy and numeracy skills.

Year 2025:
Mother tongue instruction expanded to Grade 5 strengthening regional language foundation in primary education. NEP coverage crossed 3 lakh schools with majority of institutions transitioning to new framework. Learning outcome improvements were documented showing competency-based approach yielding results. However, concerns persisted about readiness for full-scale implementation across entire education system. The reform demonstrated potential while highlighting need for sustained investment and support.
