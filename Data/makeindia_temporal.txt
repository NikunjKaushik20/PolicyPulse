Year 2014:
Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Make in India campaign to transform India into a global manufacturing hub and boost job creation. The initiative aimed to increase manufacturing's share of GDP from 15% to 25% and create 100 million new jobs. FDI limits were relaxed across 25 sectors including defense, railways, and insurance to attract foreign investment. Global giants like Samsung, Foxconn, and Xiaomi announced major manufacturing facilities in India. The campaign used aggressive marketing including the iconic lion logo to attract international investors.

Year 2015:
Foreign Direct Investment reached $55 billion, validating the Make in India strategy's appeal to global investors. The defense sector saw FDI limits raised to 49% to enable technology transfer and domestic production capabilities. Ease of Doing Business ranking improved 12 positions in World Bank index due to regulatory reforms. However, rigid labor laws and compliance burden remained significant obstacles to manufacturing expansion. Startup India was launched as a complementary initiative to boost entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem.

Year 2016:
Textiles sector received major thrust with integrated textile parks established to compete with Bangladesh and Vietnam. Electronics manufacturing crossed Rs 1 lakh crore milestone, driven primarily by mobile phone production surge. Land acquisition challenges stalled several marquee projects including industrial corridors and special economic zones. The government introduced Production Linked Incentive scheme conceptually to make India competitive in global value chains. Farmer resistance to land acquisition for industrial projects created political and implementation headaches.

Year 2017:
Automobile sector led manufacturing growth with 25% increase in exports as India became a production base for global carmakers. GST implementation caused temporary disruptions with supply chain reorganization and inventory adjustments. Pharmaceutical manufacturing gained global recognition with India supplying 60% of world's vaccine requirements. Industrial corridor projects progressed slowly due to infrastructure bottlenecks and inter-state coordination challenges. Trade tensions between US and China created opportunities for India to attract manufacturing relocations.

Year 2018:
Skill India trained 1 crore workers to address the manufacturing sector's skilled workforce requirements. Industrial corridor development, particularly Delhi-Mumbai corridor, faced delays despite being critical for manufacturing competitiveness. The US-China trade war opened windows of opportunity for Indian manufacturers to capture displaced production. Logistics costs remained double those of Asian competitors, hampering export competitiveness significantly. Defense manufacturing push showed results with domestic production of weapons systems increasing.

Year 2019:
Production Linked Incentive scheme worth Rs 2 lakh crore was designed for 13 strategic sectors including electronics and pharmaceuticals. Economic slowdown hit manufacturing hard with automobile sector crisis leading to 3 lakh job losses. Toy manufacturing became priority with import substitution strategy targeting Rs 60,000 crore domestic market. FDI inflows dropped to $50 billion due to global economic uncertainty and domestic policy concerns. Government announced measures to boost exports and improve competitiveness of Indian manufacturing.

Year 2020:
Atmanirbhar Bharat rebranded Make in India with intensified focus on self-reliance and reducing import dependence. COVID-19 disruptions exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, creating opportunities for domestic manufacturing. Lockdowns caused severe manufacturing sector contraction though medical equipment production surged rapidly. Ventilator and PPE kit production scaled from negligible to significant capacity within months. The pandemic demonstrated India's manufacturing agility in crisis situations.

Year 2021:
PLI scheme attracted committed investments of Rs 3 lakh crore across electronics, automobiles, and pharmaceuticals. Apple and Samsung announced major electronics manufacturing expansions, making India a significant production hub. Semiconductor fabrication plans were approved with government incentives to develop domestic chip manufacturing. Logistics infrastructure remained a weak link with transportation costs affecting overall competitiveness. Manufacturing employment showed strong recovery from pandemic lows with 75 lakh new jobs created.

Year 2022:
Green hydrogen manufacturing hubs were planned to position India as leader in renewable energy equipment production. Manufacturing's share of GDP crossed 18%, showing progress though still short of the 25% target. Semiconductor chip shortage globally disrupted automobile production causing delivery delays and price increases. Robotics and automation integration began improving productivity and quality in manufacturing plants. Investment in industrial infrastructure reached record levels as companies expanded capacity.

Year 2023:
Electric vehicle ecosystem took concrete shape with battery manufacturing and EV assembly operational in multiple states. Toy imports dropped 70% as quality improvements in domestic production enabled import substitution success. Infrastructure gaps in tier-2 cities including power and water supply deterred manufacturing investments. Sustainability and environmental compliance became critical factors in manufacturing location decisions. China Plus One strategy by global companies provided significant opportunities for Indian manufacturing growth.

Year 2024:
AI tools integration boosted manufacturing efficiency through predictive maintenance and robotics deployment. Pharmaceutical exports crossed $25 billion, strengthening India's position as pharmacy to the world. Labor skill gap in advanced technologies like semiconductor and robotics manufacturing emerged as constraint. Manufacturing sector created 125 lakh jobs, the highest in a decade, though quality of employment varied. Government incentives focused on high-tech manufacturing to move up the value chain.

Year 2025:
Quantum computing component manufacturing began marking entry into cutting-edge technology production. Sustainable manufacturing practices were adopted in chemical and steel sectors under environmental regulations. Global economic slowdown dampened export orders affecting manufacturing growth momentum. Advanced materials production scaled up for aerospace and defense applications. Manufacturing share of GDP approached 20%, though the 25% target appeared increasingly distant.
