Year 2017:
Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (Saubhagya) was launched in September 2017 to achieve universal household electrification. At launch, 4 crore households lacked electricity connection. Target was 100% electrification by March 2019. Scheme provided free connections to BPL households and Rs 500 subsidized connections for APL. Solar photovoltaic systems provided for remote areas without grid access.

Year 2018:
Rapid implementation connected 2.5 crore households. States like UP, Bihar, and Odisha with highest un-electrified populations prioritized. Last-mile connectivity challenged by difficult terrain and scattered habitations. Quality of supply emerged as issue with connected households facing frequent outages. Pre-paid meters introduced to ensure sustainability.

Year 2019:
India declared 100% household electrification achieved in March 2019. Total 2.82 crore households electrified under scheme. However, definitions of electrification led to some households remaining practically without power. Focus shifted to ensuring reliable 24x7 power supply. Feeder separation and infrastructure upgrades initiated.

Year 2020:
Post-electrification focus on supply quality and hours of supply. COVID highlighted importance of electricity for healthcare and education. Rural electricity consumption patterns studied for demand planning. Smart metering pilots initiated. Distribution infrastructure strengthening continued.

Year 2021:
Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) launched for infra modernization. Focus on reducing AT&C losses and improving supply reliability. Solar rooftop integration with rural electrification explored. Electricity access ensured for new households through routine connections. Power for All standards monitored.

Year 2022:
Distribution infrastructure investments continued. Feeder-level monitoring enabled quality tracking. Prepaid smart meters expanded to prevent theft and ensure sustainability. Rural areas averaged 22 hours power supply. Integration with solar and battery storage improved.

Year 2023:
Universal access maintained with 99.9% household coverage. Smart metering reached 30% of rural households. Power quality improved with average 23 hours supply. Green energy transition initiated with rural solar adoption. Cost of supply reduced through efficiency measures.

Year 2024:
Election focus on power sector ensured continued investment. PM Surya Ghar Yojana promoted rooftop solar for electrified households. Smart prepaid metering reached 50% coverage. Farm feeder separation completed in most states. Rural electricity consumption grew 8% annually.

Year 2025:
Full smart metering target set for completion. Renewable energy integration with rural grids advanced. Battery storage for reliable supply in remote areas. Time-of-day pricing introduced for demand management. Rural India becomes net power exporter in some regions.
