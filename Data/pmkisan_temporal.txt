First installment was credited to 3 crore farmers demonstrating capability for large-scale direct benefit transfer. Aadhaar linking was made mandatory to prevent duplicate claims and ensure beneficiary authentication. Database audits revealed ghost beneficiaries and fake entries requiring systematic cleanup.
