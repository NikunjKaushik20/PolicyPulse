Year 2014:
Prime Minister launched Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on Gandhi Jayanti with goal of making India open defecation free by 2019. The mission aimed to construct household toilets, improve solid waste management, and drive behavior change. Corporate India joined through CSR funding for toilet construction in rural and urban areas. Initial focus was on building physical sanitation infrastructure rapidly across rural India. Experts emphasized behavior change was equally important as infrastructure construction.

Year 2015:
Toilet construction crossed 1 crore mark demonstrating rapid infrastructure development in rural areas. Quality concerns emerged with reports of unusable toilets built merely to meet numerical targets. Women's safety improved significantly with household toilets reducing harassment and health risks. Community participation and behavior change campaigns were intensified alongside infrastructure building. Swachhata ambassadors from various fields promoted the cleanliness message nationwide.

Year 2016:
First 125 districts achieved Open Defecation Free status marking important program milestone. Water scarcity in many regions threatened toilet functionality rendering infrastructure non-usable. Solid waste management gained focus expanding urban cleanliness agenda beyond toilet construction. Village-level competitions and incentives encouraged community participation in cleanliness drives. However, sustainability of behavior change remained concern requiring sustained engagement.

Year 2017:
Haryana became first state to achieve complete Open Defecation Free status across all villages. Plastic waste choking urban drains exposed during monsoon floods highlighting inadequate processing capacity. Segregation at source campaigns trained households to separate wet and dry garbage for recycling. WASH (Water, Sanitation, Hygiene) approach integrated water supply with toilet infrastructure. Social pressure and community monitoring helped sustain toilet usage behavior.

Year 2018:
India declared 4 lakh villages Open Defecation Free marking major milestone in sanitation mission. Single-use plastic ban was announced prohibiting manufacturing of several plastic items from 2022. Toilet maintenance emerged as significant challenge with many constructed toilets falling into disrepair. Village Water and Sanitation Committees took responsibility for sustaining ODF status. Health indicators showed measurable improvement in areas that achieved sustained ODF status.

Year 2019:
India achieved nationwide Open Defecation Free status with all villages certified marking historic achievement. ODF Plus sustainability program launched shifting focus to maintaining gains and waste management. Independent surveys questioned ODF claims finding continued open defecation in some certified areas. Cultural and behavioral aspects proved more challenging than infrastructure construction. Verification and monitoring systems were strengthened to ensure authentic ODF status.

Year 2020:
COVID-19 pandemic heightened sanitation awareness with hygiene and handwashing gaining critical importance. Migrant worker return to villages tested toilet infrastructure capacity and sustainability. Swachh Bharat completed 6 years credited with significant public health outcome improvements. Sanitation and hygiene became ingrained in public consciousness due to pandemic necessities. Hand washing stations and public sanitation facilities expanded in rural and urban areas.

Year 2021:
Fecal sludge management infrastructure focused on safe septic tank cleaning and waste treatment. Grey water reuse pilots showed promise for agricultural irrigation reducing freshwater demand. Rural toilet usage rates improved demonstrating sustained behavior change beyond initial infrastructure. Wastewater treatment plants were established for safe disposal of liquid waste. ODF Plus Plus standards were conceptualized including comprehensive liquid and plastic waste management.

Year 2022:
Waste-to-energy plants became operational in 150 cities generating electricity from garbage processing. ODF Plus Plus certification introduced advanced standards for liquid waste and plastic management. Coastal plastic pollution persisted despite efforts with millions of tons collected in beach cleanups. Circular economy approach promoted resource recovery and recycling from waste streams. Composting units converted organic waste to fertilizer for agricultural use.

Year 2023:
Compost from municipal waste provided organic fertilizer benefiting sustainable agriculture practices. Extended Producer Responsibility mandated manufacturers collect and recycle plastic packaging. Urban drainage improvements remained inadequate with waterlogging during rains exposing infrastructure gaps. Waste segregation at household level became normalized in urban areas improving recycling efficiency. Behavioral sustainability remained challenge in pockets despite extensive infrastructure development.

Year 2024:
Plastic recycling industry grew creating livelihood opportunities in waste collection and processing. Biodegradable alternatives gained market share replacing single-use plastics in retail and packaging. Village water bodies were rejuvenated using treated wastewater for groundwater recharge. Sanitation workers received better safety equipment and social security benefits. Zero waste city concept piloted in select urban centers aiming to eliminate landfills.

Year 2025:
Zero Waste Cities target set for 100 urban centers with goal to eliminate landfill dumping by 2030. Swachh Bharat completed first decade transforming India's sanitation landscape and public health. Littering and open defecation persisted in pockets requiring continued behavior change efforts. Technology integration improved waste collection efficiency with GPS tracking and route optimization. Circular economy principles embedded in urban planning and waste management systems.
